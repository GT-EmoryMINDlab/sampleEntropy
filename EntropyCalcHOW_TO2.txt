After Entropy Calculation:

- Load ImageSets

FULL MEAN VOLUMES (Flat and 3D)
- Run Function meanImage.m
- When producing Images, use imagesc to make background dark (min value color limit)

FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS - FULL CORRELATION MATRIX + MEAN CORRELATION MATRIX
- Load Tight Networks
- Linearize scans with linearizeScans.m
- results is n*m array, where m is number of scans, n is length of linearized volume.
- then run isolateRois.m with linearized scans and tight networks
- then run networkCC.m on the result
- finally, run plotRearrangedCC to view image.

CORTICAL AND SUBCORTICAL FIGURES
- Load HarvOx Cortical and Subcortical
- Linearize scans with linearizeScans.m
- then run isolateRois.m with linearized scans and subcortical, then linearized and cortical
- then run cortSubCC.m
- then run cortCC.m
- finally run displayCortSubCC and displayCortCC
